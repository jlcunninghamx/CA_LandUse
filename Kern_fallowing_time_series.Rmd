# Introduction

This script generates a series of raster .tif files that summarize agricultural activity in Kern County, CA over time (1985â€“2020) using land cover data sourced from FMMP and USGS. 

Output Rasters:
Last year cropped: raster_max_Kern_1985_2020.tif
Earliest year cropped: raster_min_Kern_1985_2020.tif
Agriculture occurrence count: ag_count_Kern_1985_2020.tif
Transitions away from agriculture: transition_count_1985_2020.tif

Stored Paths: These raster files are saved in the processed folder for use in the second script Kern_fallowing_extract.Rmd

Second Script (Kern_fallowing_extract.Rmd): Reads raster files and extracts values (using a mode calculation) to populate the fields of the 1990 CDWR shapefile.
